# Introduction

This guide demonstrates how to use Git, GitHub, and the command line interface for version control.

## Step 1

In R studio, click the 'File' option and create a new R project named 5513_Assignment2. In the new project add a new qmd file which can render into HTML file.

This is how the rendered version would look like.

This is how the rendered version would look like.

## STEP 2

To initialize the git repository do the following steps:

-   Open Git Bash

-   Navigate to your project directory using the following command :

    cd /c/Users/Richa/OneDrive/Desktop/Assignment2_5513

-   Initialize a Git repository using the following command:

    git init

-   Add the example.qmd file to the staging area:

    git add git_guide.qmd

-   Commit the file:

git commit -m "Initial commit"

-   Create a new GitHub repository- repo_assignment2, and connect your local repo using the SSH key:

    git remote add origin git\@github.com:richa1623/repo_assignment2.git

    git branch -M master

    git push -u origin master

This will push the initialized folder into GitHub repository.

## STEP 3

Creating a new branch:

-   Create and switch to a new branch:

    git checkout -b testbranch

-   Make some changes in the git_guide.qmd in Rstudio:

    "This is a change on the testbranch."

-   Stage and commit the changes:

    git add git_guide.qmd

    git commit -m "Updates on testbranch"

    git push -u origin testbranch

## STEP 4

Add Data Folder and Amend Commit:

-   Create a data folder and add your Assignment 1 data to it:

    mkdir data

    mv /path/to/assignment1/data/\* data/

-   Amend the previous commit to include the data folder:

    git add data/

    git commit --amend --no-edit

    git push -f origin testbranch

## STEP 5

Simulate a Merge Conflict:

-   Switch back to the main branch:

    git checkout main

-   Modify example.qmd differently:

    "This is a conflicting change on the main branch."

-   Stage and commit:

    git add example.qmd

    git commit -m "Main branch conflicting change"

    git push origin master

-   Merge the changes from testbranch:

    git merge testbranch

-   Resolve the conflict in example.qmd by removing the markers and changes you donot wish to keep.

-   Stage, commit, and push the resolved conflict:

    git add example.qmd

    git commit -m "Resolved merge conflict"

    git push origin master
